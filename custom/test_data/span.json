The terms of this syndicate agreement include not only a block voting agreement and preemption rights, but also a prohibition on sales of the RBI shares held by the regional Raiffeisen banks (with few exceptions), if the sale would reduce the regional Raiffeisen banks' aggregate shareholding in RBI AG (direct and/or indirect) to less than 40 per cent of the share capital plus one share. (3) Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederösterreich-Wien AG holds directly and indirectly total around 25.00 per cent of the share capital of the company. By virtue of the syndicate agreement regarding RBI AG, the regional Raiffeisen banks and their direct and indirect subsidiaries as parties acting in concert as defined in § 1 (6) of the Austrian Takeover Act (ÜbG). The regional Raiffeisen banks hold a total of around 61.17 per cent of the voting rights.
